Out UK: Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European Christians fought for control of the Holy Land.

Gradually these two languages combined to become one English language. Some words in modern English – for example, ‘park’ and ‘beauty’ – are based on Norman French words. Others – for example, ‘apple’, ‘cow’ and ‘summer’ – are based on Anglo-Saxon words. In modern English there are often words with very similar meanings, one from French and one from Anglo-Saxon. ‘Demand’ (French) and ‘ask’ (Anglo-Saxon) are examples. <br>- Castles: Windsor and Edinburgh <br>- Cathedrals: Lincoln Cathedral and York Minster (famous for windows of stained glass, telling stories about the Bible and Christian saints) <br>- English wool became a very important export. <br>- People came to England from France as weavers, Germany as engineers, Italy as glass manufacturers and from Holland as canal builders.|

In the towns, growing wealth led to the development of a strong middle class.  |

* By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions had been defeated. English laws and the English language were introduced.
* Between 1680 and 1720 many refugees called **Huguenots** came from France. They were Protestants and had been persecuted for their religion. Many were educated and skilled and worked as scientists, in banking, or in weaving or other crafts.
* In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the Chartists campaigned for reform. They wanted six changes:
    * for every man to have the vote
    * elections every year
    * for all regions to be equal in the electoral system
    * secret ballots
    * for any man to be able to stand as an MP
    * for MPs to be paid
* During the Middle Ages, the English kings also fought a number of wars abroad. Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European Christians fought for control of the Holy Land. English kings also fought a long war with France, called the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116 years).

## Government and politics facts ##

* The British constitution is not written down in any single document, and therefore it is described as ‘unwritten’. This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France, has never had a revolution which led permanently to a totally new system of government.
* When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address. In Northern Ireland you will also have to show photographic identification. You will then get your ballot paper, which you take to a polling booth to fill in privately
